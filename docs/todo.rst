List of improvements
--------------------

* plugin system to be able to add some predefined structure. Also support some user input needed to prefill the structure.
* Copy/cut/paste structure in the same file and between many files
* commit without making a diff
* Support svn with pysvn and python-svn because pysvn is slow and not on pypi
* Be able to resolve the confict by editing in raw text.
* copy/paste files
* Be able to have some predefined template to create new file. Just a folder with some existing XML files.
* When we are in the versioning page (without ajax) the menu is not correct.
* Search and replace (javascript plugin)
* Add history buttons
* when we add a new field if there is one/many required children choice we should ask to the user which choice he wants.
* RTL support if multi language in the same file and/or for all the file.
* Interface to define a color system according to a dtd. Generate a css file by dtd? The difficulty is to revert the css to the interface, perhaps use comments to parse the css file.
* Create a documentation to explain how it works!
* Create a website
* jquery.filebrowser.js: reload the files when we save a new file! (now it's not displayed)
* write some tests for the js
* Support subversion without login
